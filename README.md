Omni-Notes
==========

Note taking <b>open-source</b> application aimed to have both a <b>simple interface</b> but keeping <b>smart</b> behavior.

The project was created by the absence of such applications compatible with old phones and old versions of Android that would propose, however, an attractive look and aligned with the most recent design of the Google operating system
